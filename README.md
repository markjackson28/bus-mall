LAB - 11, 12, 13, & 15b

Project Name: BusMall

This is a site I built in class on choosing a users favorite product. The user has to click 1 of 3 products they like and has 25 clicks until a chart shows up on how many times the product was view and clicked. I have used local storage in the project so if the user refreshes, the data is added to the previous chart.
